My research falls into two main areas: **Computer Vision** for **Process Automation** and for **Robotics**

My current research focuses on perception for multi-purpose manipulation tasks for autonomous aerial, planetary, and orbital robotics applications. My research uses Machine Learning as the key discipline for solving the complex tasks required for the autonomous operation of robots in space.
