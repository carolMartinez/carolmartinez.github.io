## Carol Martinez
I am from **Bucaramanga, Colombia**, and the **Mother** of three lovely **kids**. \\
I love **Cycling** and I am passionate about making robots **Perceive** the world. 

Currently, I am a **Research Scientist** at the [SnT â€“ Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability, and Trust](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt) of the [University of Luxembourg](https://wwwfr.uni.lu), in the Space Robotics Research Group [SpaceR](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt/research/spacer). In the last **15 years**, I have conducted interdisciplinary research in Computer Vision (CV), classical Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) for process automation (industry and health) and robotics (aerial, industrial, space)


My research path is motivated by the powerful ability of the **human perception** system to understand the world and the **difficulty for machines** to acquire at least part of this incredible capacity. 

My long-term goal is to push the frontiers of robotics technology for terrestrial and space applications by building **scalable**, **generalizable**, and **trustworthy** perception algorithms to empower robots to deal with unknown and uncertain environments.
