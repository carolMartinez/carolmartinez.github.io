## Carol Martinez
I am from **Bucaramanga, Colombia** \\
I am the **mother** of **3** lovely **kids**\\
Passionate about **Making Robots ¨Perceive¨** and **Cycling**.


Currently, I am a **Research Scientist** at the [SnT – Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability, and Trust](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt) of the [University of Luxembourg](https://wwwfr.uni.lu), in the Space Robotics Research Group [SpaceR](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt/research/spacer). In the last **15 years**, I have been conducting multidisciplinary research in computer vision (CV) and machine learning (ML) for automation and robotics.

My research path is motivated by the powerful ability of the **human perception** system to understand the world and the **difficulty for machines** to acquire at least part of this incredible capacity. My long-term goal is **to push the frontiers of space robotics**.  The new space era brings new technological challenges to robotics technology that, jointly with the advances in ML and CV, foretell a promising future towards achieving intelligent and multi-purpose space robotic systems. 

My current research focuses on **perception** approaches for the autonomous operation of robots in space with a special focus on **multi-purpose manipulation** tasks for planetary and orbital robotics applications.
