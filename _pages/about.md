## Carol Martinez

I am an **application-oriented researcher** with PhD and an M.Sc. in Robotics and Automation. My research focuses on  **making robots Perceive** the world. I am motivated by the powerful ability of the **human perception** system to understand the world and the **difficulty for machines** to acquire at least part of this incredible capacity.

I am motivated by the powerful ability of the **human perception** system to understand the world and the **difficulty for machines** to acquire at least part of this incredible capacity. -->

In the last **16 years**, I have led interdisciplinary research in Computer Vision (CV), classical Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) for process automation (industry and health) and robotics (aerial, industrial, space). I was a research visitor at the Queensland University of Technology and the University of Bristol, UK, and I have held positions as a Post-doctoral researcher at UPM; and Assistant Professor at PUJ Bogotá, Colombia (2015-2020). 

<!--- **My long-term goal** is to push the frontiers of robotics technology for terrestrial and space applications by building scalable, **generalizable**, and trustworthy **perception** algorithms  **to empower robots** to deal with unknown and uncertain environments. >-->

Currently, I am a **Research Scientist** at the [SnT – Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability, and Trust](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt) of the [University of Luxembourg](https://wwwfr.uni.lu), in the Space Robotics Research Group [SpaceR](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt/research/spacer). I am **leading research** in the area of *orbital robotics* (space debris removal, vision-based navigation), *robotic manipulation* (control and perception), and *on-ground testing* environments for space technology. I am also **teaching** the course "Robotic Manipulation in Space" of the Interdisciplinary Space Master (ISM) at UniLu and supervise PhD and Master students. My **current research** focuses on perception approaches for **multi-purpose** space robotic **manipulation**.


I am from **Bucaramanga, Colombia**, **Mother** of three lovely kids, and a ** volleyball and Cycling** fan.
