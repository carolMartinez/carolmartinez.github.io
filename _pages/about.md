## Carol Martinez
I am from **Bucaramanga, Colombia** and the **mother** of **3** lovely **kids**\\
I love **Cycling** and I am passionate about **Making Robots ¨Perceive¨** and understand the world.


Currently, I am a **Research Scientist** at the [SnT – Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability, and Trust](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt) of the [University of Luxembourg](https://wwwfr.uni.lu), in the Space Robotics Research Group [SpaceR](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt/research/spacer). In the last **15 years**, I have conducted interdisciplinary research in Computer Vision (CV), classical Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) for process automation (industry and health) and robotics (aerial, industrial, space)


My research path is motivated by the powerful ability of the **human perception** system to understand the world and the **difficulty for machines** to acquire at least part of this incredible capacity. 


My current research focuses on **perception** approaches for the autonomous operation of robots in space, especially for **multi-purpose manipulation** tasks for planetary and orbital robotics. It deals with fundamental and practical aspects of **Machine Learning for space** applications, including efforts on domain adaptation (to reduce sim2real gap), representation learning across multi-modal data (geometry and semantics, exploiting previous knowledge (probabilistic reasoning), uncertainty estimation for robot-environment interaction, model deployment (efficient and trustworthy), and benchmarking (high-fidelity testing environment). 

My long-term goal is to push the frontiers of robotics technology for terrestrial and space applications by building **scalable**, **generalizable**, and **trustworthy** perception algorithms to empower robots to deal with unknown and uncertain environments.
