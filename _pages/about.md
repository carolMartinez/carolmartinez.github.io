I am a Research Scientist at the SnT – Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability, and Trust of the University of Luxembourg, in the Space Robotics Research Group [SpaceR ](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt/research/spacer)

My current research focuses on perception approaches for the autonomous operation of robots in space with a special focus on multi-purpose manipulation tasks for planetary and orbital robotics applications.

Bio
======
I have a Ph.D. (2013) and an M.Sc. (2009) in Robotics and Automation from the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM), in the area of Computer Vision for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (visual tracking, pose estimation, and control). I received the outstanding Ph.D. thesis award by the UPM in 2015. I was a research visitor at the Queensland University of Technology and in the University of Bristol, UK, where I developed algorithms for tracking and pose estimation using cameras on-board aerial vehicles. I was invited to teach short courses in the area of computer vision at Tsinghua University (China) and the Technical University of Panama; and have given invited talks in different universities in Latin America (Salvador, Colombia, Panamá). I have held positions as a Post-doctoral researcher at UPM; and as an Assistant Professor at Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Bogotá, Colombia.

I have more than 15 years of experience conducting research in the Application of Computer Vision for Automation (industry and health) and Robotics (aerial, industrial, space robotics). The findings of my research have been published in well-known journals and presented in more than 30 international conferences. I have been PI and Co-PI in more than 20 projects related to aerial, industrial, and space robotics, and computer vision, and machine learning for industry and health applications. I am and have been involved in the supervision of different Ph.D. and Master Thesis, and Bachelor final projects.
