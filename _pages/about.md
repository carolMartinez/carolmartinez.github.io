## Carol Martinez
I am an application-oriented researcher. My research focuses on  **making robots Perceive** the world. I am motivated by the powerful ability of the **human perception** system to understand the world and the **difficulty for machines** to acquire at least part of this incredible capacity. 

In the last **16 years**, I have led interdisciplinary research in Computer Vision (CV), classical Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) for process automation (industry and health) and robotics (aerial, industrial, space). **My long-term goal** is to push the frontiers of robotics technology for terrestrial and space applications by building scalable, **generalizable**, and trustworthy **perception** algorithms  **to empower robots** to deal with unknown and uncertain environments. 

Currently, I am a **Research Scientist** at the [SnT â€“ Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability, and Trust](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt) of the [University of Luxembourg](https://wwwfr.uni.lu), in the Space Robotics Research Group [SpaceR](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt/research/spacer). I am **leading research** in the area of *orbital robotics* (space debris removal, vision-based navigation), *robotic manipulation* (control and perception), and *on-ground testing* environments for space technology.


I am from **Bucaramanga, Colombia**, **Mother** of three lovely kids, and a fan of **Cycling**.
